I am a second-year PhD candidate at Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML), University of Adelaide, under the supervision of Prof. Javen Qinfeng Shi, Dr. Zhen Zhang, and Dr. Yuhang Liu. 

My research lies at the intersection of causality and machine learning, focusing on (multimodal) representation learning, and generative modeling. By exploring identifiability, I aim to bridge empirical success with theoretical rigor, creating machine learning models that are both reliable and controllable. 

Looking ahead, I envision advanced AI systems that deeply understand human conceptual frameworks while remaining inherently interpretable, fostering trust and meaningful collaboration between humans and machines.
