I am a second-year PhD candidate at the <a href='https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml'>  Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML)</a>, <a href='https://www.adelaide.edu.au/'> University of Adelaide </a>, fortunately supervised by <a href='https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~javen/'> Prof. Javen Qinfeng Shi, <a href='https://zzhang.org/'> Dr. Zhen Zhang</a> and <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/yuhangliu/homepage'> Dr. Yuhang Liu</a>. 

My research explores the intersection of causality and machine learning, with particular emphasis on representation learning, causal generative modeling, and multimodal learning. In the long term, I aim to develop AI systems that uncover and leverage causal mechanisms while providing interpretable outcomes and reliable control. 

I envision advanced intelligence that not only understands human conceptual frameworks but can also be clearly understood by humans, fostering more trustworthy and collaborative AI.
