I am a second-year PhD candidate at <a href='https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml'>AIML</a>, <a href='https://www.adelaide.edu.au/'>The University of Adelaide</a>, under the supervision of <a href='https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~javen/'>Prof. Javen Qinfeng Shi</a>, <a href='https://zzhang.org/'>Dr. Zhen Zhang</a>, and <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/yuhangliu/homepage'>Dr. Yuhang Liu</a>. My research lies at the intersection of causality and machine learning, focusing on (multimodal) representation learning, and generative modeling. By exploring identifiability, I aim to bridge empirical success with theoretical rigor, creating machine learning models that are both reliable and controllable.

Looking ahead, I envision advanced AI systems that deeply understand human conceptual frameworks while remaining inherently interpretable, fostering trust and meaningful collaboration between humans and machines.

Outside of research, I find peace in reading, hiking, and taking nighttime strolls.
