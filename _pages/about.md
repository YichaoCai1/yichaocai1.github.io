I am a second-year PhD candidate at the Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML), University of Adelaide, under the supervision of Prof. Javen Qinfeng Shi, Dr. Zhen Zhang, and Dr. Yuhang Liu. I received my M.S. and B.Eng. degrees in Instrument Science from Wuhan University of Technology.

My research sits at the intersection of causality and machine learning, with a focus on (multimodal) representation learning and generative modeling. By exploring identifiability, I aim to bridge empirical success with theoretical rigor, developing machine learning models that are both reliable and controllable.

Looking ahead, I envision AI systems that deeply grasp human conceptual frameworks while remaining inherently interpretable, fostering trust and meaningful collaboration between humans and machines.
