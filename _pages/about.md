I am a second-year PhD candidate at the <a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml" target="_blank">Australian Institute for Machine Learning</a> (AIML), <a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/" target="_blank">University of Adelaide</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~javen/" target="_blank">Prof. Javen Qinfeng Shi</a>, <a href="https://zzhang.org/" target="_blank">Dr. Zhen Zhang</a>, and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/yuhangliu/homepage" target="_blank">Dr. Yuhang Liu</a>. I received my M.S. and B.Eng. degrees in Instrument Science from Wuhan University of Technology.

My research sits at the intersection of causality and machine learning, with a focus on (multimodal) representation learning and generative modeling. By exploring identifiability, I aim to bridge empirical success with theoretical rigor, developing machine learning models that are both reliable and controllable.

Looking ahead, I envision AI systems that deeply grasp human conceptual frameworks while remaining inherently interpretable, fostering trust and meaningful collaboration between humans and machines.
