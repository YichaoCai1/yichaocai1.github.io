I am a second-year PhD candidate at the <a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml" target="_blank">Australian Institute for Machine Learning</a> (AIML), <a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/" target="_blank">University of Adelaide</a>, advised by <a href="https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~javen/" target="_blank">Prof. Javen Qinfeng Shi</a>, <a href="https://zzhang.org/" target="_blank">Dr. Zhen Zhang</a>, and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/yuhangliu/homepage" target="_blank">Dr. Yuhang Liu</a>. I received my M.S. and B.Eng. degrees in Instrument Science from Wuhan University of Technology.

My research lies at the intersection of <strong>representation learning</strong>, <strong>multimodal modeling</strong>, and <strong>causality</strong>. I aim to develop principled machine learning systems that can faithfully capture semantic structure—even in the presence of noise, bias, or missing supervision.

At the core of my work is a simple question: <em>What makes a representation meaningful, controllable, and aligned with how humans understand the world?</em> I believe that building reliable and interpretable AI requires more than scale—it demands a deeper engagement with human conceptual frameworks. Looking ahead, I envision machine learning systems that reason with structure, embrace changes, and remain accountable to the values we encode in data.
