I am a first-year PhD student at the <a href='https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml'>  Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML)</a>, <a href='https://www.adelaide.edu.au/'> University of Adelaide </a>, supervised by <a href='https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~javen/'> Prof. Javen Qinfeng Shi, <a href='https://zzhang.org/'> Dr. Zhen Zhang</a> and <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/yuhangliu/homepage'> Dr. Yuhang Liu</a>. 

My research delves into the intersection of causality and machine learning, with a focus on causal representation learning and causal generative modeling. My vision is to develop machine learning models that deeply understand causality, enabling AI systems that are both controllable and interpretable.
