**Status Recognition and Defect Detection for Power System Equipment**

The project targets the recognition of power equipment's operational status, damage detection, and foreign object intrusion identification. Leveraging deep learning models for object detection and semantic segmentation, it addresses these challenges through a combination of deep learning and traditional priori-knowledge-based patter recognition techniques. Traditional image processing techniques also play a critical role in both the pre-processing and post-processing phases. Enhanced precision is achieved by strategic design, such as using a two-step strategy for small targets, while inference efficiency is boosted through knowledge distillation and model quantization.
