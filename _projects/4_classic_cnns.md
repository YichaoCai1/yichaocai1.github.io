This project involved the implementation of various classic CNN backbones, aimed at self-learning and practice. It includes code for basic classification tasks, enhanced with features such as early stopping, inference acceleration, and training monitoring. The project's code repository has received over a hundred stars, indicating its usefulness to others, especially those new to the field of deep learning. I am pleased that it serves as a resource for those beginning their journey in deep learning.
