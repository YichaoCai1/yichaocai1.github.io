<h1>Three Weekly Self-Introspections</h1>

<p><em>Yichao Cai, 25-05-2024</em>  </p>

<hr />

<p>If possible, every Monday evening, ask myself these questions, reflect, and think before moving on to next weekâ€™s work:</p>

<hr />

<h3>1. Did I take the time to learn new knowledge beyond my daily tasks this week?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Engaging in activities that expanded my understanding beyond immediate research needs. This could include reading new papers, attending seminars, or exploring different fields that could provide a fresh perspective.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h3>2. Did my research make tangible progress this week?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Assessing the specific advancements made in my research, including successful/failed experiments, writing, or documenting new ideas.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h3>3. Is my research still guided by my interest and vision?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ensuring that the work remains aligned with my core interests and long-term vision. Keeping the passion alive!</p>
</blockquote>
