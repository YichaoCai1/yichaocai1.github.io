This blog is on the topic of Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, clarifying its connection with rate-distortion theory, exploring different optimization strategies for IB, and discussing the application of the Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) and \(\beta\)-VAE within the context of representation learning. Designed as both a personal reference and a resource for others, this blog aims to provide a holistic view understanding of the IB principle.
