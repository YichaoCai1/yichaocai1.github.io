If possible, every *Monday evening*, ask myself these questions, reflect, and think before moving on to next week's work:
1. **Did I take the time to learn new knowledge beyond my daily tasks this week?**
    - Engaging in activities that expanded my understanding beyond immediate research needs. This could include reading new papers, attending seminars, or exploring different fields that could provide a fresh perspective.

2. **Did my research make tangible progress this week?**
    - Assessing the specific advancements made in my research, including sucessful/failure experiments, writing, or documenting new ideas.

3. **Is my research still guided by my interest and vision?**
    - Ensuring that the work remains aligned with my core interests and long-term vision. Keeping the passion alive!
